# Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Service Recommendation

## Overview
This project implements a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model to recommend research papers based on user-selected primary categories. The model learns an optimal recommendation strategy using a Deep Q-Network (DQN), ensuring that users receive the most relevant papers based on their chosen category.

## Methodology
The project leverages a DQN-based reinforcement learning approach where the model is trained to select the best research papers by maximizing cumulative rewards. The process involves:

1. **State Representation**: The system encodes the research paper dataset into a feature space, using attributes such as the title, summary, and category.
2. **Action Space**: The agent selects a set of top papers for a given category.
3. **Reward Mechanism**: Papers are ranked based on relevance, with higher rewards assigned to well-matched papers.
4. **Policy Learning**: The DQN model learns an optimal recommendation policy by iteratively refining its action selections.

## Model Architecture
- **Input Layer**: Encodes user-selected categories and associated paper features.
- **Hidden Layers**: Composed of dense layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction.
- **Output Layer**: Generates action probabilities to determine the best paper recommendations.

## Dataset
The research paper dataset contains metadata, including:
- **Primary Category**: The main research field of the paper.
- **Title**: The name of the research paper.
- **Summary**: A brief abstract of the paper.
- **Link**: The URL to access the full paper.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with Citation Counts**: To improve ranking by considering the impact of papers.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Utilizing user preferences and browsing history.
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining reinforcement learning with collaborative filtering.

This project demonstrates the potential of DRL in optimizing recommendations for academic research papers, enhancing the discoverability of high-quality content.
