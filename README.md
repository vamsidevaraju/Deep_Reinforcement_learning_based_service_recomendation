# Deep_Reinforcement_learning_based_service_recomendation
 This project implements a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model to recommend research papers based on user-selected primary categories. The model learns an optimal recommendation strategy using a Deep Q-Network (DQN), ensuring that users receive the most relevant papers based on their chosen category.
